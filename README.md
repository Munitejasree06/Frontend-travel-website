This project is a clone of the Airbnb website, built to demonstrate front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React. The website replicates the basic layout and functionalities of the original Airbnb site, offering a simple yet effective platform for users to explore and book accommodations.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Search Functionality**: Includes search filters such as location, check-in/check-out dates, and guest preferences.
- **Dynamic Homepage**: A welcoming homepage featuring popular destinations, featured listings, and easy navigation.
- **Interactive Booking System**: Allows users to select dates and view available listings, providing an intuitive booking process.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures consistent performance across popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Improvisations

- Enhanced UI/UX for better user experience across all devices.
- Added features like advanced search filters, booking options, and dynamic content on the homepage.
- Optimized the website for faster loading times by minimizing image sizes and refining the HTML/CSS structure.
- Applied basic SEO techniques for better search engine visibility.
- Ensured compatibility across different browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout adjustments.
- **React**: Component-based frontend library for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic elements and functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Using CSS media queries to ensure mobile-first design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
